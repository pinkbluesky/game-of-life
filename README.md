# game-of-life
This is a Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
The project and rules were from "Big Java". It is a graphical application that allows the user to choose a starting generation by clicking a grid, using the "Clear All" button, or "Fill All" button. The game continues and the user can edit the animation speed and stop the animation.
